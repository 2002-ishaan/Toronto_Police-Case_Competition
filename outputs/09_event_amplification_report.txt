EVENT AMPLIFICATION - CORRECTED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY IMPROVEMENT:
  Old Method: Compare Fri/Sat evenings vs Mon-Thu evenings
    Problem: Mixes 163 event days with 642 regular weekends
    Result: 1.08x amplification (heavily diluted signal)

  New Method: Identify anomalous high-crime days during sports seasons
    Approach: Days with crime >1.5 SD above day-of-week baseline
    Filter: Only Oct-May (Leafs) or Apr-Oct (Jays) months
    Identified: 194 likely event days
    Result: 1.56x amplification

KEY FINDINGS:
  TRUE EVENT AMPLIFICATION: 1.56x
  Previous Estimate: 1.08x (underestimated by 45%)
  Event Rate: 9.73 crimes/day
  Non-Event Rate: 6.22 crimes/day

STATION VARIABILITY:
  Highest Amplification: SHEPPARD-YONGE (2.26x)
  Lowest Amplification: ST ANDREW (1.05x)
  Average (Top 20): 1.60x

IMPLICATIONS FOR FIFA 2026:
  Use 1.56x multiplier (not 1.08x)
  This means higher officer requirements than previously estimated
  Match 1 deployment should prepare for 1.56x baseline rate
