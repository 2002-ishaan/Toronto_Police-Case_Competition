SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: OFFICER CAPACITY
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  Officer capacity (crimes per officer) is unknown
  Current assumption: 1.5 crimes/officer (arbitrary)
  Need to test how deployment changes with different capacities

TESTED SCENARIOS:
  Very High Load      : 107 shifts (capacity=0.5)
  High Load           :  64 shifts (capacity=1.0)
  Balanced ⭐          :  64 shifts (capacity=1.5)
  Efficient           :  52 shifts (capacity=2.0)
  Very Efficient      :  52 shifts (capacity=3.0)

UNCERTAINTY RANGE: 52-107 shifts (±27)

RECOMMENDATION:
  Deploy 12 officers for Match 1 (balanced scenario)
  Measure actual capacity during Match 1
  Adjust Matches 2-6 based on measured capacity
  Have reserve officers on standby for Match 1
